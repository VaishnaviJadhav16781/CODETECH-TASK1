OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
PROJECT: Creating a Python program that acts as a basic calculator
Project Objective:
Build a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user will be able to input two numbers and select the desired operation. The program will then display the result of the operation.

Core Features:
User Input:

Prompt the user to input two numbers.
Ask the user to choose an operation (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Arithmetic Operations:

Implement functions to handle the four basic arithmetic operations:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Display Results:

Perform the chosen operation on the two numbers.
Display the result to the user.
Error Handling:

Ensure the user inputs valid numbers.
Handle division by zero gracefully.
Program Loop:

Allow the user to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit the program.
Extensions:
Add more operations: Include operations like exponentiation, modulus, etc.
Graphical Interface: Use a library like Tkinter to create a GUI for the calculator.
Enhance error handling: Handle more edge cases like invalid input (non-numeric).
Learning Outcomes:
Working with functions and modular programming.
Handling user input and validating it.
Using loops and conditional statements for program control.
Basic error handling techniques.
